> **Healing • Cure • Recovery**  
> A comprehensive healthcare data management solution built for crisis zones and resource-constrained environments.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Healthcare workers in crisis zones face critical challenges:
- **4+ hours daily** spent on manual record-taking and administrative tasks
- Paper-based systems prone to loss, damage, and illegibility  
- Inability to share patient data between facilities or with international experts
- Limited digital infrastructure and offline-capable tools

**SHIFAA directly addresses the hackathon challenge:** *"How might we help medical teams rapidly collect patient information in clinics or shelters using offline, low-power tools — cutting down the 4+ hours a day admin staff currently spend on manual record-taking?"*
